Files autogenerated by Angular are NOT removed to allow pulling into a server more reliable.
Reduce the amount of files that need to be transferred upon deployment.
This was a problem in the last lab (4) and deployment became convoluted due to many files gitignored.

Files that need to be transferred upon deployment:
 • favicon.ico
 • Lab3-timetable-data.json
 • secure_info.json
