# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# Files autogenerated by Angular are NOT removed to allow pulling into a server more reliable.
# Reduce the amount of files that need to be transferred upon deployment.
# This was a problem in the last lab (4) and deployment became convoluted due to many files gitignored.

# added ignore files (These ones will need to be transferred over to server manually)
